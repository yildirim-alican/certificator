# CertifyPro User Manual (For Non-Technical Users)

This guide is for everyday users who want to create and generate certificates quickly.
No technical background is needed.

---

## 1) What You Can Do in CertifyPro

With CertifyPro, you can:
- Create a certificate template
- Add text fields (like Name, Date, Course)
- Generate one PDF certificate
- Generate many certificates at once from an Excel file
- Download all generated certificates as a ZIP file

---

## 2) Before You Start

Please prepare:
- A web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)
- Your certificate text/content
- (Optional) An Excel file for bulk generation

### Excel tips (important)
- First row must be column titles (example: Name, Department, Date)
- One person per row
- Keep data clean (no empty required cells)
- Save as `.xlsx` or `.xls`

---

## 3) Installation and First Launch

Choose one setup option below.

### One-Command Start (Easiest)

From project root, run one of these:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-dev.ps1
```

Or in Git Bash:

```bash
bash ./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

This starts backend and frontend automatically.

### Option A (Recommended): Docker Compose

Use this if Docker Desktop is already installed.

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Wait until both services are ready.
4. Open your browser:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

To stop the app:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Option B: Manual Start (Without Docker)

Use this if you prefer running frontend/backend manually.

Recommended Python versions: **3.12.x or 3.14.x**.

#### Start Backend

```bash
# Run from project root (certificator/)
cd backend
py -3.12 -m venv venv
# Git Bash:
source venv/Scripts/activate
# PowerShell:
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
python main.py
```

If you are already in `backend/`, skip `cd backend`.

#### Start Frontend (new terminal window)

```bash
# Open a NEW terminal in project root (certificator/)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If your terminal is still in `backend/`, use:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open: `http://localhost:3000`

### Quick Health Check

- If homepage opens, frontend is working.
- If bulk generation works, backend is connected.
- If not, restart both services and try again.
